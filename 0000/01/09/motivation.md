     alt="A comment exchange on dateutil issue #487 from jbrockmendel. Brock suggests: 'This is a class of cases that I intend to fix, but its not high on the priority list. As @pganssle mentioned, its a re-write as opposed to a bug-fix.  One way you could help keep this from drifting down the todo list would be to submit a PR creating a test for this case marked as xfail.' Paul responds with 'I'm going to be honest, I don't love xfail tests, but I am willing to be persuaded about that.'" />
